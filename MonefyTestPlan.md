# **Test plan for Monefy app (iOS)**

**Object of testing**: Monefy application for money management (standard version, not updated to the pro version).

**Version**: 1.2.10

**OS**: iOS 9.0 or higher

**Devices**: iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch

Monefy is a money management tool which allows users to track their expenses and income. Therefore, operations of adding this data to the app and calculating total balance/expenses for a chosen period of time is the main function of Monefy. Considering the app has a pro version, the business goal is to sell it to the customer. This goal can be achieved if the main functions of this app are working and a customer has a positive user experience. Also, we need to check that customer doesnâ€™t have access to special features until he updates to the pro version. 
So, first of all, we need to check:
 - the application can be installed and updated without losing user data
 - work of main functions: adding money to total balance, adding expenses, checking calculations of total expenses and income for a chosen period of time
 - user doesn't have access to pro features
 - design of the app is responsive and looks the same on devices with a different form factor

- iPhone 4S and newer
- iPad 2 and newer
- iPod Touch 5th gen and newer
We won't test on all of the devices because it's unnecessary and time-consuming. But we need to take into consideration display size and resolution of devices as well as there popularity (amount of users) and based on that make a decision about devices on which to test our application.

## 4 Localization testing
